<h3> NISSAN & BMW</h3>
<p> Nissan Motor Corporation (Japanese: æ—¥ç”£è‡ªå‹•è»Šæ ªå¼ä¼šç¤¾, Hepburn: Nissan JidÅsha kabushiki gaisha), often shortened to Nissan,[a] is a Japanese multinational automobile manufacturer headquartered in Nishi-ku, Yokohama, Japan. The company sells its vehicles under the Nissan and Infiniti brands, and formerly the Datsun brand, with in-house performance tuning products (including cars) labelled Nismo. The company traces back to the beginnings of the 20th century, with the Nissan zaibatsu, now called Nissan Group.

Since 1999, Nissan has been part of the Renaultâ€“Nissanâ€“Mitsubishi Alliance (Mitsubishi joining in 2016), a partnership between Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors of Japan, with Renault of France. Until January 2023, Renault held a 43.4% voting stake in Nissan, while Nissan held a 15% non-voting stake in Renault. In an overhaul in January 2023, Renault's voting stakes were decreased to 15%, making both manufacturers equal in voting stakes.[6] Since October 2016 Nissan holds a 34% controlling stake in Mitsubishi Motors.[7]

In 2017, Nissan was the sixth largest automaker in the world, after Toyota, Volkswagen Group, Hyundai Motor Group, General Motors and Ford.[8] In 2014, Nissan was the largest car manufacturer in North America.[9] With a revenue of $75 billion in 2022, Nissan was the 9th largest automobile maker in the world,[10] as well as being the leading Japanese brand in China, Russia and Mexico.[11] As of April 2018, Nissan was the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, with global sales of more than 320,000 all-electric vehicles.[12] The top-selling vehicle of the car-maker's fully-electric lineup is the Nissan LEAF, the No. 2 top-selling electric car globally, just behind the Tesla Model 3.[13]</p>

<p> Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, abbreviated as BMW (German pronunciation: [ËŒbeËÊ”É›mËˆveË] (listen)), is a German multinational manufacturer of luxury vehicles and motorcycles headquartered in Munich, Bavaria, Germany. The company was founded in 1916 as a manufacturer of aircraft engines, which it produced from 1917 to 1918 and again from 1933 to 1945.

Automobiles are marketed under the brands BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce, and motorcycles are marketed under the brand BMW Motorrad. In 2017, BMW was the world's fourteenth-largest producer of motor vehicles, with 2,279,503 vehicles produced.[2] The company has significant motor-sport history, especially in touring cars, sports cars, and the Isle of Man TT.

BMW is headquartered in Munich and produces motor vehicles in Germany, Brazil, China, India, Mexico, the Netherlands, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The Quandt family is a long-term shareholder of the company, following investments by the brothers Herbert and Harald Quandt in 1959 that saved BMW from bankruptcy, with the remaining shares owned by the public.</p>
